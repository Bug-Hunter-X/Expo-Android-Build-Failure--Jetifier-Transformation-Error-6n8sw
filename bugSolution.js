Several strategies can resolve `jetifier` transformation errors:

1. **Identify Conflicting Dependencies:** Carefully examine the error message. It pinpoints the problematic dependency.  Check your `package.json` to see if you have multiple packages relying on different versions of the same support library.

2. **Update or Downgrade Dependencies:** Try updating all your dependencies to their latest versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. Alternatively, if updating creates new problems, downgrade problematic libraries to compatible versions.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes a clean build can resolve temporary issues.  Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then try building again.

4. **Eject (Advanced):** As a last resort, you can eject from Expo.  This gives you more direct control over the Android build process, but it increases complexity and reduces some benefits of Expo.  Proceed cautiously.

5. **Use AndroidX:** AndroidX is the modern replacement for the older Android support libraries.  Ensure that your project uses AndroidX to minimize compatibility issues.  Check for `androidx` in your dependencies.  If not present, try migrating your project to use it.  Some packages require this specific transition.

6. **Check for Duplicate Packages:** Look for instances of duplicate packages or transitive dependencies.  The `npm ls` or `yarn why <package>` command can help you identify and resolve these situations.

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates implementing these solutions.  Specifically, it will address dependencies and resolve the conflicts to achieve a successful build.
